# eVenture Restful API

## Info

eVenture is a platform for organising community lectures and events hosted by SoC bootcampers.

People wishing to attend events can register for tickets and SoC bootcampers/volunteers can manage event listings (create events, edit events, delete events and manage tickets).

Specifically it handles requests for event and ticket information including GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE etc requests.

This server handles http requests made by [eVenture](https://eventure.vercel.app) client.

The server lives [here](https://api.eventure.link).

The code for the client can be found [here](https://github.com/michaelfswann/front-end-final-project-communiteam).
